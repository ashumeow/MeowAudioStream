MeowAudioStream is a Javascript Library where audio is loaded and streamed faster through WebRTC.
<br> <br>
For Demo --> <a href="http://windowsgeekpro.in/MeowAudioStream/audio.html">CLICK HERE</a><br> <br>
Currently, it is a simple audio streaming demo.<br>It works through any Web browser or through any device (PC/Laptop/mobile). <br>The <code>MediaStream</code> only seems to work in IE. But, <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> and <code>RTCDataChannel</code> don't work in IE. <br>
P.S.:- The audio player appears a little bit small in mobile. Just zoom it. <br>If your net connection is good, then the audio streaming is fast in Windows Phone. If player gets issue, then refresh the browser. <br>Like always, it is good in Android too. <br> I haven't tested in Opera, Safari or any Apple devices, Hope it works well.
